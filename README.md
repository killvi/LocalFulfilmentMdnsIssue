### Goal

Trigger Identify request from MDNS scan.

### Problem

Currently, I try to trigger Identify request from a MDNS scan with a hub. But no Identify request is send. Although, when i worked in my previous office with many hubs and devices, MDNS scan successfully triggered Identify request. Today, I just work with one hub and no discovarable devices from MDSN scan, here, no Identify request is send anymore.
